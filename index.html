<p style="text-align: left;">My name is Ryan Kerrison, I was born and raised in Darwin and just recently moved to Melbourne to study at RMIT. I enjoy playing soccer back in Darwin but have yet to start playing down here. I have a severe addiction to the NBA, with a lot of my free time, spent watching games or just wasting time looking at many obscure statistics of players.&nbsp; I completed year 12 in 2017, and I spent all of 2018 working at a primary school and saving money for my eventual move to Melbourne. &nbsp;At the primary school I ran the intervention program for transition/year 1 students who needed extra one on one work to complete the curriculum. I found this work very rewarding and working with children is something that I would like to do in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Interest in IT</strong></h2>
<p>The main thing that I would say sparked my interest in IT is because of playing computer games. When I was around 12 or 13, I was very interested in loads of different computer games. Always one issue I had with the games was that they never really ran that well on the laptop that I shared with my brother. This led me to saving up all my money and researching information to build my own personal computer. I enjoyed the process of researching the computer components and trying to figure out what would provide me the best bang for my buck.&nbsp; Eventually after saving up and selling what I could, I ordered the parts and built the computer which worked way better than I could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I chose to study at RMIT is a very silly one at that. Being from Darwin, I wanted to experience the Melbourne CBD as much as possible, so instead of going to Monash or Deakin, RMIT seemed like the perfect place for me. Giving me a lot more opportunities to experience the city, which has turned out to be better than I would have ever thought. I am very happy with my decision to come to RMIT and I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself going to any other university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my studies at RMIT I hope to initially gain a broad range of knowledge of the IT sector so that I can then figure out what area of IT I would want to work in.&nbsp; With this knowledge I will be able to figure out what career would be best for me and would also provide the most happiness and job satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=04709ce6ae4bbd6b&amp;tk=1d79mqr12f8om802&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3">https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=04709ce6ae4bbd6b&amp;tk=1d79mqr12f8om802&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3</a></p>
<p>My ideal job would be to work in the IT sector in or involved with the NBA. The job that I have found online is a web developer for Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment who are the primary owners of the NBA team Indiana Pacers. The aspects of this job that interest me the most, is that it involves something that I genuinely enjoy, so it would allow for the work to be more interesting for me. The job is seeking a Full Stack Web developer which will help manage the day to day needs of multiple websites involved with the Indiana Pacers.</p>
<p>The job requires a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and at least 3 years of experience in web development and a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Python. I currently have no experience in web development, but I am currently on my way to complete a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. The best method gaining the skills required to be sufficiently capable in doing this job would be to practice making websites, and maybe investigate options to volunteer contribute to some already pre-existing websites for experience.</p>
