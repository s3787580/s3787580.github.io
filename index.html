<p>My name is Ryan Kerrison, I was born and raised in Darwin and just recently moved to Melbourne to study at RMIT. I enjoy playing soccer back in Darwin but have yet to start playing down here. I have a severe addiction to the NBA, with a lot of my free time, spent watching games or just wasting time looking at many obscure statistics of players.&nbsp; I completed year 12 in 2017, and I spent all of 2018 working at a primary school and saving money for my eventual move to Melbourne. &nbsp;At the primary school I ran the intervention program for transition/year 1 students who needed extra one on one work to complete the curriculum. I found this work very rewarding and working with children is something that I would like to do in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
<p>The main thing that I would say sparked my interest in IT is because of playing computer games. When I was around 12 or 13, I was very interested in loads of different computer games. Always one issue I had with the games was that they never really ran that well on the laptop that I shared with my brother. This led me to saving up all my money and researching information to build my own personal computer. I enjoyed the process of researching the computer components and trying to figure out what would provide me the best bang for my buck.&nbsp; Eventually after saving up and selling what I could, I ordered the parts and built the computer which worked way better than I could have ever imagined.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I chose to study at RMIT is a very silly one at that. Being from Darwin, I wanted to experience the Melbourne CBD as much as possible, so instead of going to Monash or Deakin, RMIT seemed like the perfect place for me. Giving me a lot more opportunities to experience the city, which has turned out to be better than I would have ever thought. I am very happy with my decision to come to RMIT and I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself going to any other university.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During my studies at RMIT I hope to initially gain a broad range of knowledge of the IT sector so that I can then figure out what area of IT I would want to work in.&nbsp; With this knowledge I will be able to figure out what career would be best for me and would also provide the most happiness and job satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p>My ideal job would be to work in the IT sector in or involved with the NBA. The job that I have found online is a web developer for Pacers Sports &amp; Entertainment who are the primary owners of the NBA team Indiana Pacers. The aspects of this job that interest me the most, is that it involves something that I genuinely enjoy, so it would allow for the work to be more interesting for me. The job is seeking a Full Stack Web developer which will help manage the day to day needs of multiple websites involved with the Indiana Pacers.</p>
<p>The job requires a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and at least 3 years of experience in web development and a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, Python. I currently have no experience in web development, but I am currently on my way to complete a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. The best method gaining the skills required to be sufficiently capable in doing this job would be to practice making websites, and maybe investigate options to volunteer contribute to some already pre-existing websites for experience.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<p>There are many different types of online tests that are used by employers to get a greater insight into a potential employee characteristics.</p>
<h3>Learning Style Test</h3>
<p>Completed the learning style test at <a href="http://www.whatismylearningstyle.com/learning-style-test-1.html">http://www.whatismylearningstyle.com/learning-style-test-1.html</a> and it came back with an auditory learner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Big Five Personality Test</h3>
<p>Did a Big Five factor test at <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2.9,3.7,3.6,2.4,3.1#_I">https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=2.9,3.7,3.6,2.4,3.1#_I</a>.<img src="https://i.imgur.com/xFjgTDb.png" alt="" width="550" height="171" /></p>
<h3>Myers-Briggs Test</h3>
<p>Completed a Myers-Briggs test at <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">https://www.16personalities.com/</a> and came back with this result:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KIk0zkC.png" alt="" width="252" height="273" /></p>
<p>These tests give a great overview of how I operate as a person. The main takeaway from these tests have shown that I am a very independent worker, which can apparently make more rigidly structured academics more challenging. I do think these tests give a very general view because mostly I do not agree with a lot of the results of the tests. Especially in aspects of imagination and being artistic which are two of the main qualities outline by the Myers-Briggs test.</p>
<p>In forming a group, I should be aware of this aspect of myself and I should try my best to make sure it doesn&rsquo;t inhibit my quality of work in a team. I should always give the most effort I possibly can in a group, to allow for the best quality of work to be completed as a team.</p>

<h2>Project</h2>
<p>During the regular season of the NBA there are all up 1230 games. Now this is too many games for one person to watch, so I would want to create a method that will help me decide what games are most worth me watching. This project would take the form of a website that analyses the play of these of key players and recommends the games based on how well they played compared to their averages. I am a big fan of watching fellow Australians play in the NBA so most of the players that I would choose to be analysed would be Australia players who play for a variety of different teams.</p>
<p>This project would help me save loads of time in deciding what games I should watch over the course of the NBA season. This will be created using a mixture of html and the NBA-API and endpoint. The NBA-API allows live stats to be streamed to a website or app.</p>
<p>One feature of the website that is vital, is that no results or stats from the game should be shown. Instead an indicator should be shown based on the watchability of the game based on the stats of the players I have selected. This means that I won&rsquo;t have to deal with any spoilers when accessing the website. A spoiler being accidently shown will dramatically reduce the watchability of the game, if the results of the game is already known</p>
<p>The way the watchability of the game should be determined could be done so through a variety of factors. First the average points per game and assists per game of a player can be compared with the single game, if there is a significant increase in production of that player in the game, then it should be recommended.</p>
<p>If within the last 2 minutes of game time the score is no bigger than 10 points between the two teams. Close games are a good game, and the games should be extra recommended if the game goes down to the wire.</p>
<p>If there are two or more key players in the same game, then it should be recommended. If two or more players are playing against each other then the game should almost automatically be highly recommended. This is because if Ben Simmons and Patty Mills are versing each other I would want to see it.</p>
<p>The players that a featured in the ideal games to be watched should be easily added and changed by the end user without too much hassle. This will allow for anyone to have a personalised version of the website better allowing more people to save time in deciding what NBA games they want to watch.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any experience in making these types of projects, but everyone must start somewhere. Also, this project will help me in my progress towards my ideal job. It is a perfect building point for the skills needed to be acquired to work at my ideal job. The combination of NBA and web development is basically the perfect duo that could be possible.</p>
<p>If the project is successful, the best NBA game for each day will be recommended allowing the hasn&rsquo;t user to save time and stress in deciding what the best game to watch is. A spoiler free game recommender is a very useful tool, I could not find any similar products on the market that allows this type of recommendation without showing stats. This allows people with busy lives to have the best NBA experience they can possibly have without spending too much time.</p>
